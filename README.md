#Project 7

1. In this project, we used JavaScript and APIdoc to send HTTP requests to an API using asynchronous the Asynch/Await technique.

2. To install the project's directories, you must first run these commands using GitBash:
 
 * cd ~               # make sure you're in your home directory
 * mkdir projects     # create a folder called projects
 * cd projects        # change directory into the new projects folder

3. Then you must clone the repo from GitHub using one of the following commands:
 
*  if you are using HTTPS
 git clone https://github.com/username/hm07-qa-us.git
 
 * if you are using SSH
 git clone git@github.com:username/hm07-qa-us.git
 
4. Next, you must run "npm install" from the console in your project folder

5. To work on the project, open VS Code, select File>Open Folder, then select the hm07-qa-us folder that you cloned to your computer

6. In config.js, replace the API URL with the unique link generated after the launch of Urban Grocers server

7. To run each test, replace "/your/endpoint" with an endpoint for GET, PUT, DELETE, POST requests from api docs or swagger.

8. To execute your code, run 'npx jest ("test name")' within VS Code's console
